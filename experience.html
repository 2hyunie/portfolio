    <h2>Experience</h2><br></br>
    <p>This section provides descriptions to my previous experiences, including my education, work experience, and projects.</p><br></br>
    <h3><b>1. EDUCATION</b></h3><br></br>
    <p>❁ COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ❁</p>
    <p><i>M.A in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences (QMSS)</i></p>
    <p>[Sept 2021- Dec 2022]</p>
    <p>Courses: Data Analysis, Data Mining, GIS & Spatial Analysis, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Energy System Economics and Optimization, Data Visualization</p><br></br>
    <p>❁ UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE ❁</p>
    <p><i>B.A in Geography</i></p>
    <p>[Oct 2017 - Jul 2020]</p>
    <p>Courses: Geopolitics, Environmental Knowledges and the Politics of Expertise, Political Ecology, Legal Geographies</p>
    <p>My B.A dissertation was on the geopolitics of PM 2.5 and the everyday experiences of South Koreans. I carried out 216 surveys with young adults (aged 20-39) to gain insight. Along with the survey results, I analyzed articles through discourse analysis to investigate how PM 2.5 is embedded into the daily lives of ordinary people and how "China" is framed within the environmental discourse in Korea.</p>

    <h3><b>2. WORK EXPERIENCE</b></h3><br></br>
    <p>❁ SAMSUNG SDI AMERICA ❁</p>
    <p><i>Marketing Assistant Manager</i></p>
    <p>[Mar 2023 - Current]</p><br></br>
    <p>❁ THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION (ICCT) ❁</p>
    <p><i>Intern at the Fuels Program</i></p>
    <p>[Jun 2022 - Aug 2022]</p>
    <p>During this internship, I took part in three different projects, where I co-authored in two of the white papers that are soon to be published (TBD). The first project I worked on dealt with comparing the costs of using electricity vs. renewable natural gas (RNG) in landfills and dary farms. For this project, I collected data on production, transportation, and the processing of RNG to perform life-cycle analysis and cash flow analysis of the pathways. I also performed spatial analysis using QGIS to locate the case study areas and its distance to the natural gas pipeline. The second project entailed gathering information on the hydrogen supply chain to analyze the logistics of shipping green hydrogen from Brazil and Egypt to the Europen Union (EU). The final project I participated was researching opportuniites and barriers for decarbonizing the U.S aviation sector. Besides conducting research for these projects, I helped developing outreach materials for ICCT such as drafting video scripts on ethanol pathways.</p><br></br>
    <p>❁ COLUMBIA CENTER ON SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT (CCSI) ❁</p>
    <p><i>Data Analysis Intern</i></p>
    <p>[Feb 2022 - May 2022]</p>
    <p>As a research assistant, I assessed the feasibility of using a macroeconomic model in Nigeria by conducting data analysis to explain the costs and benefits of energy transition. I learned how to use the Low Emissions Analysis Platform (LEAP) to forecast energy data in Nigeria. I also carried out literature review on fossil fuel divestment, and how much equity share divestment is required to impact the share price.</p><br></br>
    <p>❁ SHILLIM INSTITUTE ❁</p>
    <p><i>Policy Intern</i></p>
    <p>[Jun 2021 - Aug 2021]</p>
    <p>During this summer internship, I initiated research on the gaps of Indian environmental and development policies on the Western Ghats, a large mountain range in India. I consulted with other local NGOs and environmental consulting firms to investigate strategies used to conserve the area. To sum up my findings, I wrote a 41-page report with recommendations to the Shillim Institute, highlighting some local initiatives that can be done at a community level.</p><br></br>
    <p>❁ INSTITUTE OF EURO-AFRICAN STUDIES (IEAS) ❁</p>
    <p><i>Research Intern</i></p>
    <p>[Sept 2020 - Dec 2020]</p>
    <p>I wrote a report comparing the neoliberal solid waste management system and the informal economy in Lagos, Nigeria and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which was published in the institute's ISSN approved "Issue Paper". I also aided in statistical analysis using World Bank data and translated articles from English to Korean. </p><br></br>
    <h3><b>3. PROJECTS</b></h3><br></br>
    <p><a href="https://pointsunknown.nyc/final-projects/GSAPP-Spring-2022/Climate-Change/index.html" target="_blank"><b>❋ Scrollytelling Article on Central Valley Drought and Almond Farming ❋</b></a><p>
    <p>[Jan 2022 - May 2022]</p>
    <p>I lead this project of creating a scrollytelling article on the Central Valley drought and the consequences on almond farming. As a group of three, we interviewed academics, practitioners, reporters, and farmers to provide a timely insight on the different perspectives of groundwater depletion and the changing landscape of agriculture in California. I made visualizations based on an interview with a farmer, and analyzed drought, precipitation, farm income, and groundwater level data to produce a more in-depth visualizaion for the article. Finally, I applied webmapping techniques using Mapbox, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to produce the report with multiple visualizations that are publised online.</p><br></br>
    <p><a href="https://2hyunie.github.io/qmss-dv-group-g/index.html" target="_blank"><b>❋ Data Visualization of Covid-19 and Housing Prices in NYC ❋</b></a></p>
    <p>[Jan 2022 - May 2022]</p>
    <p>As a group of three, we built a website that provided insight into the relationship between Covid-19 cases and the housing market in New York City (NYC). I used R to clean and analyze the data on the housing prices and created visualizations, including one interactive graph. I also tidied the visualizations using Adobe Illustrator. Moreover, I taught myself how to code and construct a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript to enhance the quality of this project.</p><br></br>
    <p><b>❋ KPMG Practicum on Flood Prediction ❋</b></p>
    <p>[Jan 2022 - May 2022]</p>
    <p>As part of a large group of 20 students, I polished my communication skills in gathering multiple people's opinions and providing a timely update on the project every meeting. I worked on detecting signs of flooding in the shorelines of Miami, Florida using satellite imagery. I helped with the initial exploratory data analysis using basic flood data to produce spatial visualizations using Python as well as evaluating various business impacts of the flood.</p><br></br>
    <p><b>❋ Joint SDG Fund - UN Practicum ❋</b></li>
    <p>[Sept 2021 - Dec 2021]</p>
    <p>I supported investigating alternative real time proxy indicators to measure the progress of SDG 2 with staple food prices, climate indicators, and education indicators by cleaning and analyzing data using Python. I contributed in writing and editing the entire report.</p><br></br>
    <p><b>❋ GIS Project on Crime Levels in Cambridge ❋</b></p>
    <p>[Dec 2018 - Jan 2019]</p>
    <p>This project examined crime levels in Cambridge to see if certain aspects of antisocial behavioral crimes could be explained by spatial analysis. I used QGIS and GeoDa to create quantile maps, excess risk maps, cluster maps, heat maps, and significance maps.</p><br></br>
    <p><a href="https://www.polygeia.com/_files/ugd/f53ce9_bc41631e80514f15b0970dbe1b7d7fac.pdf?index=true" target="_blank"><b>❋ Polygeia: Addressing anemia in the women of Tanzania: Improving screening and diagnosis ❋</b></a></p>
    <p>[Feb 2018 - Nov 2018]</p>
    <p>As part of a student think tank, Polygeia, which works on global health policies, I was part of a team commissioned by the Cambridge Development Initiative (CDI), to research on ways of diagnosing anemia for women living in rural Tanzania. As a team, we presented at the Global Health Conference in London and finalized the report based on the feedback we received from health experts.</p>
